# Language Reference

This reference guide details the language's fundamental syntax and logic in a concise yet thorough manner. While it focuses on the core structure, descriptions of standard functions, modules, and secondary object types are located in the [Standard Library][stdlib] documentation.

[stdlib]: ../standard-library/

For those seeking a different starting point:

??? info "New Users"
    [The Tutorial][tutorial] provides a beginner-friendly introduction.

??? info "Pascal and C/C++ Developers"
    Two specialized resources are available. [Extending and Embedding][embed] offers a conceptual overview of creating extension modules, while the [API Reference Manual][api] provides exhaustive technical details on available interfaces.
